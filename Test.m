% Example script for estimation task 1
%
% This script performs the following actions :
% 1. Constructs a camera model loosely based on an iPhone6
% 2. Constructs a calibration grid 1m on a side with 10 mm grid spacing .
% 3. Positions the grid somewhere in space .
% 4. Places the camera in a' random ' location so that the grid
% fills the camera image . Check this location to see if the
% grid outline is outside the image ; if not , more the camera nearer
% to the grid . This is NOT a smart way of positioning things , but
% it models the likely behaviour of a human user .
% 5. Compute the image of the grid and constructs a set of grid - image
% correspondences and add 'noise ' ot the image .
% 6. Convert some of the correspondences to outliers .
% 7. Carry out a RANSAC estimation of the homography .

% 1. Construct the Camera model
[ KMatrix , CameraHeight , CameraWidth ] = BuildCamera ;

% 2. Construct a 1m by 1m grid with 10 mm tiles in the grid frame
% The grid is a set of 4- element vectors [x y 0 1] '.
GridWidth = 1000;
GridIncrement = 10;
CalibrationGrid = BuildGrid ( GridIncrement , GridWidth );

% 3. Choose somewhere in space for the grid
% T_ow is the 4x4 tranformation matrix from grid to world .
T_ow = PositionGrid ();
% 4 Choose a 'random ' location for the camera that fills the image .
% T_cw is the 4x4 transformation matrix from camera to world
T_cw = FillImage (T_ow , KMatrix , GridWidth , CameraHeight , CameraWidth );

% 5 We now fill the camera with a noisy image of the grid and generate
% the point correpondences .
% Correspond is a set of pairs of vectors of the form [[u v]' [x y]']
% for each grid corner that lies inside the image .
Correspond = BuildNoisyCorrespondences (T_ow ,T_cw , CalibrationGrid , ...
KMatrix , CameraHeight , CameraWidth );
