% This script performs a full estimation and optimisation of
% a camera K- matrix .
%
% 1. Construct a camera model loosely based on an iPhone6
% 2. Construct a calibration grid 1m on a side with 10 mm grid spacing .
% 3. Position the grid somewhere in space.
%
% Perform the following actions on each image , repeating an image
% if the homography estimation failed.
% 4. Place the camera somewhere in space to generate a full image
% of tile square corner locations.
% 5. Generate the noisy image of the grid.
% 6. Add in some outliers.
% 7. Perform a Ransac estimate of the homography
%
% Once the homographies have been estimated
% 8. Build the regressor for estimating the K- matrix
% 9. Carry out the Cholesky factorization and invert . This generates
% an initial model of the K- Matrix

% The number of calibration images to use
nImages = 6;

% 1. Construct the Camera model
[ KMatrix , CameraHeight , CameraWidth ] = BuildCamera ;

% 2. Construct a 1m by 1m grid with 10 mm tiles in the grid frame
% The grid is a set of 4- element vectors [x y 0 1] '.
GridWidth = 1000;
GridIncrement = 10;
CalibrationGrid = BuildGrid ( GridIncrement , GridWidth );

% 3. Choose somewhere in space for the grid
% T_ow is the 4x4 tranformation matrix from grid to world .
T_ow = PositionGrid ();

% Define the scaling to use
if CameraHeight > CameraWidth
	CameraScale = 2.0 / CameraHeight ;
else
	CameraScale = 2.0 / CameraWidth ;
end
GridScale = 2.0/ GridWidth ;

% Generate the calibration images and the homographies
% Store Homographies and concensus sets in a Matlab Cell Array
% called HomogData .
HomogData = cell ( nImages ,3);
% Define the numbers to access the DataCell
NHOMOGRAPHY = 1;
NCORRESPOND = 2;
NCONSENSUS = 3;

for CalImage = 1: nImages

	% Keep looking for homographies until we get a non - zero result .
	% 'Estimating ' is a toggle .
	Estimating = 1;
    while Estimating == 1
        % The default is 'Success ', i.e. Estimating = 0
        Estimating = 0;

        % 4 Choose a 'random ' location for the camera that fills the
        % image .
        % T_cw is the 4x4 transformation matrix from camera to world
        T_cw = FillImage (T_ow , KMatrix , GridWidth , CameraHeight , CameraWidth );

        % 5 We now fill the camera with a noisy image of the grid and
        % generate the point correpondences .
        % Correspond is a set of pairs of vectors of the form
        % [[u v]' [x y]'] for each grid corner that lies inside the
        % image .
        Correspond = BuildNoisyCorrespondences (T_ow ,T_cw ,...
            CalibrationGrid , KMatrix , CameraHeight , CameraWidth );

        % 6. Add in some 'outliers ' by replacing [u v]' with a point
        % somewhere in the image .
        % Define the Outlier probability
        pOutlier = 0.05;
        for j = 1: length ( Correspond )
            r = rand ;
            if r < pOutlier
                Correspond (1,j) = rand * ( CameraWidth -1);
                Correspond (2,j) = rand * ( CameraHeight -1);
            end
        end

        % Now scale the grid and camera to [-1, 1] to improve
        % the conditioning of the Homography estimation .
        Correspond(1:2 ,:) = Correspond(1:2 ,:)*CameraScale - 1.0;
        Correspond(3:4 ,:) = Correspond(3:4 ,:)*GridScale ;

        % 7. Perform the Ransac estimation
        % If the Ransac fails it retuns a zero Homography

        % The maximum error allowed before rejecting a point .
        Maxerror = 3.0;
        % I am using a variance of 0.5 pixels so sigma is sqrt (0.5)
        % 3 pixels in the * NORM * is 3 sigma as there are 2 errors involved
        % in the norm (u and v).
        %
        % Note : The above is in pixels - so scale before Ransac !
        % The number of runs when creating the consensus set.
        RansacRuns = 50;
        [Homog , BestConsensus ] = ...
            RansacHomog(Correspond , Maxerror*CameraScale , RansacRuns);

        if Homog (3 ,3) > 0
            % This image worked . So record the homography and the
            % consensus set
            HomogData{CalImage,NHOMOGRAPHY} = Homog ;
            HomogData{CalImage,NCORRESPOND} = Correspond ;
            HomogData{CalImage,NCONSENSUS} = BestConsensus ;
        else
            % The estimate failed . So go around again .
            Estimating = 1;
        end

    end % end of the while Estimating == 1 loop
end % end of the nImages loop

% 8. Build the regressor for estimating the Cholesky product
Regressor = zeros (2*nImages ,6);
for CalImage = 1: nImages
	r1 = 2*CalImage - 1;
	r2 = 2*CalImage ;
	Regressor (r1:r2 ,:) = KMatrixRowPair(HomogData{CalImage ,1}) ;
end

% Find the kernel
[U,D,V] = svd (Regressor ,'econ');
D = diag (D);
[M,I] = min (D);
% K is the estimate of the kernel
K = V(:,I);

% The matrix to be constructed needs to be positive definite
% It is necessary that K (1) be positive .
if K (1) < 0
	K = -K;
end

% Construct the matrix Phi from the kernel
Phi = zeros (3);

Phi (1 ,1) = K (1);
Phi (1 ,2) = K (2);
Phi (1 ,3) = K (3);
Phi (2 ,2) = K (4);
Phi (2 ,3) = K (5);
Phi (3 ,3) = K (6);

% Add in the symmetric components
Phi (2 ,1) = Phi (1 ,2);
Phi (3 ,1) = Phi (1 ,3);
Phi (3 ,2) = Phi (2 ,3);

% Check if the matrix is positive definite
e = eig(Phi );
for j = 1:3
	if e(j) <= 0
        error ('The Cholesky product is not positive definite ')
	end
end

% 9. Carry out the Cholesky factorization
KMatEstimated = chol (Phi);

% Invert the factor
KMatEstimated = KMatEstimated \ eye (3);

% The scaling of the grid has no impact on the scaling of
% the K- matrix as the vector 't' takes no part in the estimate
% of Phi. Only the image scaling has an impact .

% first normalize the KMatrix
KMatEstimated = KMatEstimated / KMatEstimated (3 ,3);

Seed = KMatEstimated;
% Add 1.0 to the translation part of the image
Seed (1 ,3) = Seed (1 ,3) + 1;
Seed (2 ,3) = Seed (2 ,3) + 1;
Seed (1:2 ,1:3) = Seed (1:2 ,1:3) / CameraScale;

% Optimize the K- matrix
OptKMatrix = OptimiseKMatrix ( KMatEstimated , HomogData );

% Add 1.0 to the translation part of the image
OptKMatrix (1 ,3) = OptKMatrix (1 ,3) + 1;
OptKMatrix (2 ,3) = OptKMatrix (2 ,3) + 1;

% Rescale back to pixels
OptKMatrix (1:2 ,1:3) = OptKMatrix (1:2 ,1:3) / CameraScale;
