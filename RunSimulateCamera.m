% Simulates viewing a 3D object (a cube ) to demonstrate the
% structures built up to calibrate a camera .


% Construct a Camera
[ KMatrix , CameraHeight , CameraWidth ] = BuildCamera ;

% Construct an object in its own frame
Cube = BuildCube ;

% Position the object in space
T_ow = PositionObject ;

% Position the camera so that it is likely that the object can be seen
T_cw = PositionCamera ( T_ow );

% Look at what we have
ViewCamera (Cube ,T_ow , KMatrix , CameraHeight , CameraWidth , T_cw )
