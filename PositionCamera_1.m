% PositionCamera
% Generates a 'random ' camera frame that almost points
% at the origin of the calibration object back along the object 's
% z- axis ( which is perturbed ). Aim is to 'fill ' the camera image
% with calibration grid .
%
% T_ow is the 4x4 frame of the calibration grid in world coordinates .
% Distance is the base distance to the grid from the camera
% along the normal and a random factor of 0.1 times the distance is
% added .
