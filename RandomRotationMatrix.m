function [ R ] = RandomRotationMatrix ()
% RandomRotationMatrix
% Generates a random rotation matrix by starting with
% two random vectors and then normalising , projecting
% out components and then generating the final
% column by using the cross - product .

% Make sure we have a random matrix larger than 'eps '
xnorm = 0;
while xnorm < eps
x = rand (3 ,1);
xnorm = norm (x);
end
% The 'random ' unit vector
xhat = x / xnorm ;

ynorm = 0;
while ynorm < eps
y = rand (3 ,1);
% Project out xhat by finding the dot product and removing from y
y = y - (y'* xhat )* xhat ;
ynorm = norm (y);
end
% The 'random ' unit y vector
yhat = y / ynorm ;

% Find the third vector as the cross product of x and y
zhat = cross (xhat , yhat );

% Construct the rotation matrix for return
R = [ xhat yhat zhat ];
