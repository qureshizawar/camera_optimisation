% 1. Constructs a camera model loosely based on an iPhone6
% 2. Constructs a calibration grid 1m on a side with 10 mm grid spacing .
% 3. Positions the grid somewhere in space .
%
% Perform the following actions on each image , repeating an image
% if the homography estimation failed .
% 4. Places the camera somewhere in space to generate a full image
% of tile square corner locations .
% 5. Generate the noisy image of the grid .
% 6. Add in some outliers .
% 7. Perform a Ransac estimate of the homography
%
% Once the homographies have been estimated
% 8. Build the regressor for estimating the K- matrix
% 9. Carry out the Cholesky factorization and invert .

% The number of calibration images to use
nImages = 6;

% 1. Construct the Camera model
[ KMatrix , CameraHeight , CameraWidth ] = BuildCamera ;

KMatrix

% 2. Construct a 1m by 1m grid with 10 mm tiles in the grid frame
% The grid is a set of 4- element vectors [x y 0 1] '.
GridWidth = 1000;
GridIncrement = 10;
CalibrationGrid = BuildGrid ( GridIncrement , GridWidth );

% 3. Choose somewhere in space for the grid
% T_ow is the 4x4 tranformation matrix from grid to world .
T_ow = PositionGrid ();

% Define the scaling to use
if CameraHeight > CameraWidth
CameraScale = 2.0 / CameraHeight ;

        T_cw = FillImage (T_ow , KMatrix , GridWidth , CameraHeight , CameraWidth );

        % 5 We now fill the camera with a noisy image of the grid and
        % generate the point correpondences.
        % Correspond is a set of pairs of vectors of the form [[u v]' [x y]']
        % for each grid corner that lies inside the image .
        Correspond = BuildNoisyCorrespondences (T_ow ,T_cw , CalibrationGrid , ...
                KMatrix , CameraHeight , CameraWidth );

        % 6. Add in some 'outliers ' by replacing [u v]' with a point
        % somewhere in the image .
        % Define the Outlier probability
        pOutlier = 0.05;
        for j = 1: length ( Correspond )

            end
        end

        % Now scale the grid and camera to [-1, 1] to improve
        % the conditioning of the Homography estimation .

        % If the Ransac fails it retuns a zero Homography
        Maxerror = 3.0; % The maximum error allowed before rejecting a point .
        % I am using a variance of 0.5 pixels so sigma is sqrt (0.5)
        % 3 pixels in the * NORM * is 3 sigma as there are 2 errors involved
        % in the norm (u and v).
        %
        % Note : The above is in pixels - so scale before Ransac !
        RansacRuns = 50; % The number of runs when creating the consensus set .
        [Homog , BestConsensus ] = ...

            % consensus set

            Estimating = 1;
        end
        
    end % end of the while Estimating == 1 loop
end % end of the nImages loop

% 8. Build the regressor for estimating the Cholesky product
Regressor = zeros (2* nImages ,6);
for CalImage = 1: nImages
	r1 = 2* CalImage -1;
	r2 = 2* CalImage ;
	Regressor (r1:r2 ,:) = KMatrixRowPair ( HomogData { CalImage ,1}) ;
end

% Find the kernel
[U,D,V] = svd (Regressor,'econ');
D = diag (D);
[M,I] = min (D);
% K is the estimate of the kernel
K = V(:,I);

% The matrix to be constructed needs to be positive definite
% It is necessary that K (1) be positive .
if K (1) < 0
    K = -K;
end

% Construct the matrix Phi from the kernel
Phi = zeros (3);

Phi (1 ,1) = K (1);
Phi (1 ,2) = K (2);
Phi (1 ,3) = K (3);
Phi (2 ,2) = K (4);
Phi (2 ,3) = K (5);
Phi (3 ,3) = K (6);

% Add in the symmetric components
Phi (2 ,1) = Phi (1 ,2);
Phi (3 ,1) = Phi (1 ,3);
Phi (3 ,2) = Phi (2 ,3);

% Check if the matrix is positive definite
e = eig(Phi );
for j = 1:3
	if e(j) <= 0
        error ('The Cholesky product is not positive definite ')
	end
end

% 9. Carry out the Cholesky factorization
KMatEstimated = chol (Phi);

% Invert the factor
KMatEstimated = KMatEstimated \ eye (3);

% The scaling of the grid has no impact on the scaling of
% the K- matrix as the vector 't' takes no part in the estimate
% of Phi. Only the image scaling has an impact .

% first normalize the KMatrix
KMatEstimated = KMatEstimated / KMatEstimated (3 ,3);

% Add 1.0 to the translation part of the image
KMatEstimated (1 ,3) = KMatEstimated (1 ,3) + 1;
KMatEstimated (2 ,3) = KMatEstimated (2 ,3) + 1;

% Rescale back to pixels
KMatEstimated (1:2 ,1:3) = KMatEstimated (1:2 ,1:3) / CameraScale
